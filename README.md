# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). The challenge was supposed to be for web scenario. But I have choose to use this challenge with React-Native for study scenarios.
